    - You can register (with email confirmation).
    - Filter restaurants by category or in the searchbar

2. As a provider,
    - Have exclusive access to your restaurants' back office.
    - Interact with your restaurants (CRUD).
    - View your modifications in the view as a regular user.

3. As a super admin,

    - Create categories for global use.
